## The Weather Web App :sunny: 

Here I've built a weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API - in Miami!! :sunny:

---

## Questions answered and techniques used

- What an API is and how to use it
- Basic JSON
- How to use fetch() in Javascript
- How to use promises in JavaScript
- How to work with the Date() object in JavaScript
- How to work with time difference


### The presented data on my web app

The city name, the temperature (rounded to 1 decimal place), and what type of weather it is (the "description" in the JSON)

### And the time of the sunrise and sunset ðŸŒ‡

This was tricky but in my code you'll see I have the time difference for Miami. 

###  Weather forecast

Showing a forecast for the next 5 days. With min and max temperature and the description.
In the openweathermap API there's another endpoint that will give us a forecast of the next five days.

### Styling of my weather app ðŸŽ¨

I used a hero picture with a shadow to make it look good and welcoming!

### Requirements reached ðŸ§ª

- To fetch data from the API using fetch() in JavaScript 
- Name of city, current tempereature and weather conditions and the forecast. 
- The page works on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop (Is responsive)-
